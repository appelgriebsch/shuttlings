# üéÑ Day 5: The dangerous open Internet

*Ho ho ho! Santa's got his hands full this year with the grand Christmas present delivery! He's all set to send out orders to his trusty warehouse at the South Pole, but oh my, what a festive twist we have here!*

*You see, the magical undersea optic fiber cable Santa installed back in 2005 got a bit of a surprise - a ship dragged its anchor right through it! Now, instead of sending messages through that secret snowy channel, Santa must use the open Internet, where those mischievous hackers under the Grinch's command are waiting to disrupt them.*

*But Santa, with his big belly laugh, says, "No time for encryption, my dear elves! Christmas is just 20 days away, and we've got heaps of other magical coding tasks to sprinkle with Christmas magic! Ho ho ho!"*

## ‚≠ê Task 1: Car go many festivity ü§î

Santa has a plan for evading the hackers' attempts at disrupting his gift order requests: disguising them as Cargo.toml files!

Santa will be sending his gift orders as POST requests to `/5/manifest` with TOML documents that are valid Cargo.toml manifests.
The `package.metadata` field allows arbitrary data to be stored in Cargo manifests, but for the worker elves in the warehouse to understand the order, they need it written out as a plain newline-separated list (with no newline at the end).

The `package.metadata.orders` field will be an array of maps that *should* have `item` (String) and `quantity` (u32) fields.
Invalid orders in the array should be ignored.
If the manifest does not contain any valid orders, the response should be `204 No Content`.

### üîî Tips

- [toml](https://crates.io/crates/toml)

### üí† Examples

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/5/manifest -H "Content-Type: application/toml" --data '
[package]
name = "not-a-gift-order"
authors = ["Not Santa"]
keywords = ["Christmas 2024"]

[[package.metadata.orders]]
item = "Toy car"
quantity = 2

[[package.metadata.orders]]
item = "Lego brick"
quantity = 230
'

Toy car: 2
Lego brick: 230
```

The following example responds with 204 since there are no valid orders (the one provided has an invalid `quantity` data type).

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8000/5/manifest -H "Content-Type: application/toml" --data '
[package]
name = "coal-in-a-bowl"
authors = ["H4CK3R_13E7"]
keywords = ["Christmas 2024"]

[[package.metadata.orders]]
item = "Coal"
quantity = "Hahaha get rekt"
'

...
< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
...
```

## ‚≠ê Task 2: How to make crates.io

"Hah! It works, but... oh no!"
The hackers discovered the endpoint and are now planning to spam it with invalid Cargo.toml files to overload the server!
A cat and mouse game is taking shape.

We need to add a Cargo manifest parser that can deny all invalid manifests.
If a manifest is invalid, respond with a `400 Bad Request` code and the response body `Invalid manifest`.

### üîî Tips

- [cargo-manifest](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-manifest)

### üí† Examples

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8000/5/manifest -H "Content-Type: application/toml" --data '
[package]
name = false
authors = ["Not Santa"]
keywords = ["Christmas 2024"]
'

...
< HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
...
Invalid manifest
```

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8000/5/manifest -H "Content-Type: application/toml" --data '
[package]
name = "not-a-gift-order"
authors = ["Not Santa"]
keywords = ["Christmas 2024"]

[profile.release]
incremental = "stonks"
'

...
< HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
...
Invalid manifest
```

## ‚≠ê Task 3: Use the magic word

Filtering out bad manifests worked for a while, but now the hackers have refined their strategy and are mostly sending valid manifests.
Time to add more requirements! *(said the project manager)*

Notice how all of Santa's manifests have the package keyword `Christmas 2024`?
The hackers' manifests are not mimicking that part, so we can deny requests that don't include that keyword!
Respond with another 400 and the text `Magic keyword not provided` if that is the case.

### üí† Example

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8000/5/manifest -H "Content-Type: application/toml" --data '
[package]
name = "grass"
authors = ["A vegan cow"]
keywords = ["Moooooo"]
'

...
< HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
...
Magic keyword not provided
```

## üéÅ Task 4: Cargo.yaml? üò≥ (70 bonus points)

"You know what," Santa says, "time for some trickery.
Let's confuse the hackers even more by also allowing the manifest to be passed as YAML and JSON documents!"

Use the `Content-Type` header to know which format the incoming request has.
If the header has an unsupported value, return a `415 Unsupported Media Type`.
All previous rules still apply to the new formats.

### üí† Examples

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8000/5/manifest -H "Content-Type: text/html" --data '<h1>Hello, bird!</h1>'

...
< HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
...
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/5/manifest -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" --data '
package:
  name: big-chungus-sleigh
  version: "2.0.24"
  metadata:
    orders:
      - item: "Toy train"
        quantity: 5
  rust-version: "1.69"
  keywords:
    - "Christmas 2024"
'

Toy train: 5
```
