# üéÑ Day 9: The *Cookies and Milk* Factory (part 1)

*Wanting to spread the joy of sweet treats beyond the holidays, Santa built a wondrous factory to mass produce the perfect treat duo: cookies and milk packaged as a 2-in-1 deal!*

*Branded as "Santa's Cookies and Milk," the product quickly became a worldwide hit, delighting taste buds and hearts alike. The success was so enormous that Santa now considers building more factories to meet the growing demand!*

## ‚≠ê Task 1: The Leaky Bucket of Milk

Santa has a bucket in the *Cookies and Milk* factory that can store 5 liters of milk.
As long as the bucket is not full, the bucket is magically refilled with 1 liter of milk every second.
Every time the production line makes a pack of milk, 1 liter is taken from the bucket.

Withdrawing milk from the bucket when it is empty creates an empty pack of milk, which can not be accepted in this factory.
Santa needs a way to ensure this never ever happens!

Make a POST endpoint `/9/milk` that makes sure the bucket is never empty.
It should take no request body as input.
If there is milk in the bucket, respond with `200 OK` and the string `Milk withdrawn\n`.
If there is no milk in the bucket, respond with `429 Too Many Requests` and the string `No milk available\n`.

### üîî Tips

- [leaky-bucket](https://crates.io/crates/leaky-bucket)
- [Sharing state in Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/#sharing-state-with-handlers)
- [Application State in Actix Web](https://actix.rs/docs/application#state)
- [State in Rocket](https://rocket.rs/v0.5/guide/state/)

### üí† Example

When the bucket is full, this sequence of calls should produce the following responses:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
sleep 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
sleep 2
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk

## ‚≠ê Task 2: Hey dude, how 'bout a gallon of milk and some cookies? üá∫üá∏

Santa is thinking of opening the next *Cookies and Milk* factory in the United States.
Over there, he is planning to have a 5-gallon bucket instead, but... "How many liters is that?"

Modify the endpoint from Task 1 so that it can convert between liters and US gallons.

The `Content-Type: application/json` header value determines the endpoint's behavior:

- If the content type is not JSON, respond like in Task 1.
- If the content type is JSON, parse the body and convert between the volume units as `f32`s (examples below).
  - If the JSON is invalid, or the input does not contain exactly **one** of the valid input fields, respond with a `400 Bad Request`.

The same rate-limiting rules should apply, regardless of whether it is a milk withdrawal request or a unit conversion request.

### üîî Tips

- [JSON in Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/struct.Json.html)
- [JSON in Actix Web](https://actix.rs/docs/request)
- [JSON in Rocket](https://rocket.rs/v0.5/guide/requests/#json)

### üí† Examples

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000/9/milk -d '{"liters":5}'

{"gallons":1.3208603}
```

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000/9/milk -d '{"gallons":5}'

{"liters":18.92706}
```

```bash
curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000/9/milk -d '{"liters":1,"gallons":5}'

...
< HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
...
```

## ‚≠ê Task 3: Oi bruv, fancy a pint o' milk and some biscuits? üá¨üáß

Crikey! What's all this then?
When Santa popped over to the UK to open a *Cookies and Milk* factory there, he quickly learned they spell it as *litres*.
Not only that, but they'd rather have their bucket hold 5 UK pints instead of litres or gallons.
Quite the adjustment, innit?

Modify the same endpoint to convert back and forth between *litres* and UK pints.
The same rules and behaviors as in Task 2 still apply.

### üí† Example

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000/9/milk -d '{"litres":2}'

{"pints":3.519508}
```

## üéÅ Task 4: Top up the cup (75 bonus points)

Oh, Santa can snap his fingers and magically refill the bucket with milk, just like that?
What do we even need these factories for then?

Add a POST endpoint `/9/refill` for instantly refilling the bucket to its max capacity, that responds `200 OK`.

### üí† Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/refill
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/9/milk
