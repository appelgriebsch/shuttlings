# üéÑ Day -1: We are so back!!

Welcome to Shuttle's Christmas Code Hunt 2024!

Santa is excited beyond belief to have you back this year to help him.

This challenge is a warmup challenge made to familiarize you with solving a Shuttlings code challenge and deploying your CCH24 project to Shuttle.

## ‚≠ê Getting started

First, let's get set up for working with Rust and Shuttle!

If you need any help with the steps below, feel free to ask for help in the CCH channel in
[Discord](https://discord.gg/shuttle) or by using the Support Chat in the bottom right corner.

To install Rust and the `cargo` command, visit [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the instructions.
You can check your installed version with `cargo -V` (1.78 or above is required).

To install the Shuttle CLI, use one of the options in the [installation docs](https://docs.shuttle.dev/getting-started/installation).
You can check your installed version with `shuttle -V` (0.48.0 or above is required).

Navigate to a directory where you want to create your CCH24 solution, and use the command below to initialize a project.
When selecting a template, choose a Hello World template in one of the web frameworks.
Axum, Actix Web, and Rocket are the ones we recommend if you don't know which one to pick.

```bash
shuttle init --name shuttlings-cch24
```

Then you can `cd` into the generated directory and open your code editor of choice.

Now you should be all set for starting Task 1!

## üîî Challenge layout

Every challenge is split into one or more *Core Tasks* (marked with ‚≠ê) and one or more *Bonus Tasks* (marked with üéÅ).
To **complete** a challenge, you only need to pass the tests for the *Core Tasks* ‚≠ê.
*Bonus Tasks* üéÅ are harder to complete but give even more points. Their tests contain more edge cases and curveballs.

## ‚≠ê Task 1: Hello, bird!

*Santa has grown tired of the "Hello, world!" phrase. Everyone uses it all the time!*
*Time to switch things up and say... "Hello, bird!"*
*Why? I hope we will find out.*

The starter template from the init command you ran earlier should have a root endpoint `/` responding to GET requests with a "Hello, world!" string and a `200 OK` status code.
Change the response string so that it responds with "Hello, bird!" instead.

### üîî Tips

In your project directory, you can use `shuttle run` to test your Shuttle app locally (see below).

- [MDN web docs: 200 OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)

### üí† Example

Many tasks throughout CCH24 can easily be tested with a `curl` command.
You can use it when testing locally, and then verify that the deployed app works.

```bash
# While the app is running with `shuttle run`
curl -I -X GET http://localhost:8000/

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/

Hello, bird!
```

If everything looks good now, and you want to get some sweet ‚ú®*imaginary points*‚ú® already, scroll to the bottom of this page to try validating with the local validator and on Shuttle!

## üéÅ Task 2: Seek and you will find (0 bonus points)

*Santa thinks the North Pole has been awfully quiet since last year.*
*"Time to introduce some cheerful tunes! Let's call it ‚ú®Vibe of the Day‚ú®.*
*Now, where did I put that link to the first song?"*

For this bonus task, add an endpoint on `/-1/seek` that responds to GET requests with the `302 Found` redirection response.

For a 302 response to be valid, it needs to have the `Location` header set to where the requested resource can be found.
The Location header value we want today is (as requested by Santa): `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gc4QTqslN4`

### üîî Tips

- [Actix Web Responses](https://actix.rs/docs/response)
- [Rocket Responses](https://rocket.rs/v0.5/guide/responses/)
- [MDN web docs: 302 Found](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302)

### üí† Example

```bash
curl -I -X GET http://localhost:8000/-1/seek

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gc4QTqslN4
...
```
