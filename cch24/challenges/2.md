# üéÑ Day 2: Ridiculous Routing

*Back in the early days of the Internet, Santa joyfully built a magical data center igloo at the North Pole to streamline his gift-giving magic! Using glistening ice bricks mixed with enchanting snowflakes for insulation, the igloo was filled with candy-cane striped servers and ice crystal fiber optics.*

## ‚≠ê Task 1: Egregious Encryption

Santa is having his network routers in the data center igloo upgraded to the next generation.
For reasons unknown, he uses a special IP routing algorithm to obfuscate the traffic on the internal network.
(An elf said that it just looks like a terrible implementation of symmetric encryption.)
He now needs your help to implement a simple web API for verifying the calculations in the routing algorithm.

The algorithm for IPv4 addresses is as follows:

To calculate the destination IP of a packet, take the source IP and apply a *key* address.
The formula `from + key == dest` (where "`+`" is **overflowing addition**) is applied to each of the four *octets* separately.

Make a GET endpoint `/2/dest` that takes the query parameters `from` and `key` and responds with the `dest` address as text.

### üîî Tips

Overflowing addition for the `u8` type means that adding 255 and 1 gives 0 (the values wrap around in the interval 0-255).

- [Rust docs: u8](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u8.html)
- [Integer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow)

### üí† Examples

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/2/dest?from=10.0.0.0&key=1.2.3.255"

11.2.3.255
```

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/2/dest?from=128.128.33.0&key=255.0.255.33"

127.128.32.33
```

## ‚≠ê Task 2: Going the other way

Santa occasionally also wants to double check that the routing calculations are correct.

Implement the GET endpoint `/2/key` that instead takes the parameters `from` and `to` and returns the `key` that was used to calculate the destination (it reverses the calculation in Task 1).

### üí† Examples

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/2/key?from=10.0.0.0&to=11.2.3.255"

1.2.3.255
```

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/2/key?from=128.128.33.0&to=127.128.32.33"

255.0.255.33
```

## üéÅ Task 3: What happened to version 5? (50 bonus points)

To keep up with the times, Santa also wants to use this type of routing for IPv6 packets.
He became a bit bored with elementary school math and decided that for IPv6 packets, the algorithm should **use XOR instead of overflowing addition**.

Implement `/2/v6/dest` and `/2/v6/key` in the same way as in Task 1 and 2, but using IPv6 addresses.

### üí† Examples

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/2/v6/dest?from=fe80::1&key=5:6:7::3333"

fe85:6:7::3332
```

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/2/v6/key?from=aaaa::aaaa&to=5555:ffff:c:0:0:c:1234:5555"

ffff:ffff:c::c:1234:ffff
```
