# üéÑ Day 16: A mystery gift wrapped in a cookie

*In the heart of the North Pole, Santa was renowned not only for his joyful spirit but also as the genius behind the world's most innovative gift wraps.*

*Santa turned to a clandestine supplier, acquiring hair-thin transparent plastic wraps unseen by the naked eye. This advanced material, integrated with Santa's digital signature, encased each genuine gift, verifying its authenticity. Upon unwrapping, the paper emitted a warm glow and a personal message from Santa himself.*

*This pioneering approach shielded against counterfeit gifts, securing Santa's title as the world's best gift wrap manufacturer. Through his diligent R&D, Santa ensured each unwrapping was a unique, magical experience.*

## ‚≠ê Task 1: Client-side distributed database?

To be able to detect counterfeit Christmas gifts, Santa wraps them in a hair-thin transparent plastic wrap from a secret supplier.
The wrap allows Santa to digitally sign the presents, so that he later can verify their authenticity.

Make a POST endpoint `/16/wrap` that takes an arbitrary JSON request body, and responds with `200 OK` and an appropriate `Set-Cookie` header for setting the client's `gift` cookie to a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains the JSON in some way. You decide what type of encryption to use.

The validator client will then make a second request, a GET to `/16/unwrap`.
If the first response was correctly made, the second request will have the `Cookie` header set accordingly.
This endpoint should decode the JWT in the cookie, and respond with the same JSON object that was sent when creating it.
If the header or `gift` cookie is missing, respond with `400 Bad Request`.

### üîî Tips

All shortcuts are allowed, as long as the validator is happy.

- [MDN Web Docs: Set-Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie)
- [jsonwebtoken](https://crates.io/crates/jsonwebtoken)
- [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)

### üí† Example

In this example, the string `(JWT)` symbolises the actual JWT that your first endpoint creates.
Copy it from the first response to make a valid second request.

```bash
curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000/16/wrap -d '{"cookie is delicious?": true}'
...
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< set-cookie: gift=(JWT)
...

curl -H "Cookie: gift=(JWT)" http://localhost:8000/16/unwrap
{"cookie is delicious?":true}
```

## üéÅ Task 2: Present Encryption Magic (200 bonus points)

After looking in the basement of Santa's gift wrapping facility, you find some dusty old wrapped gifts.
With a confused look, you ask Santa where they are from.

"Those must be left-over gifts from last year," he laughs, "But be careful, last year we found multiple counterfeits. Let's check the authenticity of the gift wraps to be sure."

Implement a POST endpoint `/16/decode` that takes a JWT (string) as the request body:

- The endpoint should return the decoded *claims* JSON object if the JWT is valid and Santa signed it.
- If the header is invalid, return `400 Bad Request`.
- If the signature is invalid, return `401 Unauthorized`.
- If the JWT is invalid for any other reason, return `400 Bad Request`.

Santa bumps your shoulder and says "You will also need this:"

He hands you an envelope with a [note](../validator/assets/day16_santa_public_key.pem).

As you look up from the note in confusion, Santa has magically disappeared.
Looks like the instructions are a bit unclear, but there's work to do, so you decide to try anyways.

### üîî Tips

- Debug the requests and JWTs sent by the validator to figure out what is required next.
- Santa has a reputation of being lazy when following standards and best practices, and you might need to adapt.
