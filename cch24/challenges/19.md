## ‚≠ê Task 1: Candlelight Reveals Unread Delights

Santa is building an API for his Quote Book and wrote to you that it should be a classic *CRUD*.
However, you notice a weird detail: "*CRUD: Cite Remove Undo Draft*"...
Santa really loves breaking standards for the sake of it, doesn't he?

Use [shuttle-shared-db](https://docs.shuttle.dev/resources/shuttle-shared-db) to get a Postgres DB to store the quotes.
Here's an example SQL schema that you can use for this challenge:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quotes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    author TEXT NOT NULL,
    quote TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    version INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);
```

The endpoints required are as follows.
If nothing else is specified, the response code is `200 OK`.
Check the example below for the JSON request and response schemas.

- POST `/19/reset`: Clear the `quotes` table in the database.
- GET `/19/cite/{id}`: Respond with the quote of the given ID. Use `404 Not Found` if a quote with the ID does not exist.
- DELETE `/19/remove/{id}`: Delete and respond with the quote of the given ID. Same `404` logic as above.
- PUT `/19/undo/{id}`: Update the author and text, and increment the version number of the quote of the given ID. Respond with the updated quote. Same `404` logic as above.
- POST `/19/draft`: Add a quote with a random UUID v4. Respond with the quote and `201 Created`.

### üîî Tips

- [shuttle-shared-db](https://docs.shuttle.dev/resources/shuttle-shared-db)
- [sqlx](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/)
- [uuid](https://docs.rs/uuid/latest/uuid/)
- [chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/)
- Activating the `uuid` and `chrono` features on `sqlx` will make your life easier.

### üí† Example

The value of `created_at` should be a valid UTC timestamp, the specific value does not matter.
Notice how `version` changes to 2, and `created_at` is unchanged.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000/19/draft -d '{"author":"Santa","quote":"Ho ho ho!"}'

{"id":"3dd7e875-3c17-470b-986a-e39377e55e59","author":"Santa","quote":"Ho ho ho!","created_at":"2024-12-19T12:01:09.709025Z","version":1}

# Use the correct UUID from the draft response in the undo request
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000/19/undo/3dd7e875-3c17-470b-986a-e39377e55e59 -d '{"author":"Santa","quote":"I changed my mind..."}'

{"id":"3dd7e875-3c17-470b-986a-e39377e55e59","author":"Santa","quote":"I changed my mind...","created_at":"2024-12-19T12:01:09.709025Z","version":2}
```

## üéÅ Task 2: The Paginator has entered the cabin (75 bonus points)

Santa needs a nice way to arrange the quotes on every page on his e-reader.
The e-reader has very little memory, so it can't store all quotes at once and needs to fetch one page at a time.
The server needs to keep track of which page the reader will request when Santa turns to the next page.

Add a GET endpoint `/19/list` that returns an object with:

- a list of quotes, sorted by created date, oldest first, up to 3 quotes per page,
- a page number,
- a *token*:
  - if there are more pages to fetch after the current one, the token should be set to a random 16-character ASCII alphanumerical string,
  - otherwise, it should be set to `null`.

If the `token` query parameter is set, the listing endpoint should return the next page that the token is referring to.
If the token is unknown or badly formatted, return `400`.
Multiple token holders should be able to fetch different pages at different times.

To keep thing simple:

- The list of quotes will not be modified during runs through the paginator.
- The tokens do not need to be persistent. They can optionally be discarded when they reach the final page.

### üí† Examples

```bash
# Setup: add 5 quotes by resetting and calling this 5 times
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000/19/draft -d '{"author":"Santa","quote":"Ho ho ho!"}'
...

curl "http://localhost:8000/19/list"
{"quotes":[{ ... },{ ... },{ ... }],"page":1,"next_token":"MZUEzpijMBMU3mb8"}

curl "http://localhost:8000/19/list?token=MZUEzpijMBMU3mb8"
{"quotes":[{ ... },{ ... }],"page":2,"next_token":null}
```
