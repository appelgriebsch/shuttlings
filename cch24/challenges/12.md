# 🎄 Day 12: The *Cookies and Milk* Factory (part 2)

*As Santa's additional factories thrived globally, his innovative 4x4 packing strategy became an instant holiday market hit. Each "Santa's Cookies and Milk" pack hid a delightful surprise—a playful mix of cookies and milk cartons arranged in varying patterns.*

## ⭐ Task 1: It's game time!

Each *Santa's Cookies and Milk* pack should contain a "random" arrangement of cookies and milk cartons in a 4x4 grid, totalling 16 items.
To their great joy, the elves came up with an awesome idea that will make their day-to-day work more entertaining: Playing *Connect 4*! (but with a smaller board)

1. Implement a data model for representing the 4x4 grid of tiles that can be either Empty, Cookie, or Milk.
2. Add a string representation for the current state of the board, a 5x6 rectangle of emojis, using ⬛🍪🥛 for tiles and ⬜ for walls (see below). The string should have a trailing `\n` on the last line.
3. Add a constructor for an empty board. Add an empty board to the handler state.
4. Add a GET `/12/board` endpoint that returns the current state of the board (`200 OK`).
5. Add a POST `/12/reset` endpoint that resets the board to an empty state, and then returns it (`200 OK`).

### 🔔 Tips

- Use a locking primitive like [Mutex](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Mutex.html) or [RwLock](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.RwLock.html) to read and write to the board state in different handlers.

### 💠 Examples

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/12/board
⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/12/reset
⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜
```

## ⭐ Task 2: "I'm gonna do what's called a pro-gamer move"

Let's add the gameplay!

Add a function for detecting if the game has ended with a winner:

- If 4 of the same item covers a full row or column or diagonal, that team wins.
- If all 16 slots are filled without any 4-in-a-row, there is "No winner."
- Otherwise, the game has not ended yet.

If the game has ended, add the winner status as the last line in the string representation of the board (the last line should still have a trailing newline).
Two examples of boards with their winners shown:

```text
⬜🍪⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜🍪⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜🍪⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜🍪⬛⬛⬛⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜
🍪 wins!
```

```text
⬜🥛🍪🥛🍪⬜
⬜🍪🥛🍪🥛⬜
⬜🍪🥛🍪🥛⬜
⬜🍪🥛🍪🥛⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜
No winner.
```

Now, let's add the POST endpoint `/12/place/{team}/{column}` for placing items:

- `{team}` is either `cookie` or `milk`. `{column}` is a number between 1 and 4. If either is invalid, return `400 Bad Request` (response body does not matter).
- If the column requested is already full, return the board with a `503 Service Unavailable` status.
- If the game is over (has a winner or no winner), return the board with a `503 Service Unavailable` status.
- The endpoint should place the incoming item by letting it fall down the column and land in the lowest empty tile. After the new item has been placed, return the board with a `200 OK` status.

Since the production tempo in the factory needs to remain high, the elves don't have time to make sure they are taking turns during gameplay.
They simplify the rules and say that both teams can always place items as long as the game has not ended.
This also helps ensure the contents in each pack remains "random".

If all of that is done, we should have a working *Connect 4*!

## 🎁 Task 3: Not very random randomness (75 bonus points)

Santa thinks the "random" placement in the *Connect 4* game is nice, but not random enough!
He decides that there should also be a way to generate "truly random" arrangements of items, and lets you get the job done!

For internal testing of the randomness, Santa wants to be able to retry the same random sequence of packs from the RNG. To achieve this, we will use a seeded RNG with a hardcoded seed.

1. Add the [rand](https://crates.io/crates/rand) crate as a dependency.
2. Add a method in your *Connect 4* board data model for creating a new board filled with random items. The method should take a `&mut rand::rngs::StdRng` and call `.gen::<bool>()` (`use rand::Rng;`) for each tile, from the top left, row by row. If the bool is true, place a Cookie, otherwise place Milk.
3. Add a seeded RNG `rand::rngs::StdRng::seed_from_u64(2024)` (`use rand::SeedableRng;`) with a locking primitive to the handler state.
4. Modify the `/12/reset` endpoint from Task 1 so that it also resets the RNG to a new and seeded one (same as shown above).
5. Add a GET `/12/random-board` that generates a random board and returns its string representation (including its winner).

If this works correctly, calls to the random-board endpoint should produce the same sequence of boards after every reset. The first two are shown below.

(Note: Randomly filled boards might have 4-in-a-row of both Cookie and Milk. Such boards are invalid in gameplay. Therefore, the displayed winner in this task's output is ignored by the validator.)

### 💠 Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/12/reset
...

curl http://localhost:8000/12/random-board
⬜🍪🍪🍪🍪⬜
⬜🥛🍪🍪🥛⬜
⬜🥛🥛🥛🥛⬜
⬜🍪🥛🍪🥛⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜
🍪 wins!

curl http://localhost:8000/12/random-board
⬜🍪🥛🍪🍪⬜
⬜🥛🍪🥛🍪⬜
⬜🥛🍪🍪🍪⬜
⬜🍪🥛🥛🥛⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜
No winner.
```
